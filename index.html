<p>STEMcoding Education Ohio is a non-profit orgnization that is registered in the state of Ohio. At the time of this writing (August 2020) we do not yet have 501c3 status.

<p>STEMcoding Education Ohio is led by Dr. Chris Orban and Dr. Richelle Teeling-Smith. The organization has been formed to encourage more science and math teachers to integrate computer science and data science into their classrooms and to facilitate that work.

<p>STEMcoding Education Ohio runs a website to help teachers which is hosted at <a href="http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com">http://stemcoding.herokuapp.com</a> This site (a.k.a. the "STEMcoding learning management system" or STEMcoding LMS) runs on code that was developed at Ohio State University. We received permission to use this code to set up the site through a licensing agreement with Ohio State University that was finalized in July 2020. 

<p>STEMcoding Education Ohio is unrelated to a group called "STEMcoding lab" in Pittsburg and we have chosen the title of our non-profit to help distinguish the organizations.
